# Drought-Monitoring

This repository contains Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts for agricultural drought monitoring using Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). Leveraging the capabilities of Landsat 8 and MODIS satellite imagery, the scripts analyze vegetation and temperature conditions to identify drought patterns across agricultural landscapes.

In addition to vegetation and temperature-based indices, this repository includes scripts for calculating rainfall deviation using CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station) data. Rainfall deviation analysis is particularly critical for monitoring drought in rain-fed agricultural systems, where crop productivity depends heavily on seasonal rainfall patterns.

Agricultural drought significantly impacts food security, rural livelihoods, and the global economy. Unlike meteorological drought, which is defined by a lack of precipitation, agricultural drought reflects the deficiency in soil moisture and its effects on crop health. Timely and accurate monitoring of agricultural drought is crucial for implementing effective mitigation strategies and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.

The integration of remote sensing indices like VCI, TCI, and VHI, along with rainfall deviation analysis, offers a robust framework to assess drought conditions at both spatial and temporal scales. These tools enable a comprehensive understanding of drought severity and its impacts, particularly in rain-fed agricultural regions. This repository aims to facilitate the use of GEE for efficient and reproducible drought monitoring workflows.
